Product icons are the visual expression of a brand’s products, services, and tools. Simple, bold, and friendly, they communicate the core idea and intent of a product. While each product icon is visually distinct, all product icons for a given brand should be unified through concept and execution.
Use these guidelines as a starting point to ensure that your product icon colors and key elements reflect your brand identity.</string>
